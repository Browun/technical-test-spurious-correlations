# Spurious-Correlations
Example of a spurious regression between Tesla Vehicle Production (units) and US Nonfarm Business Productivity (index) from 2012-Q4 to 2018-Q1.

This predominantly utilises [plotly](https://plot.ly/) for visualisation as I like the interaction it brings to complex sets of data. Ultimately, in this case there was simply too few variables to enable some of the more interesting featureas such as (*Heatmaps*)[https://plot.ly/python/heatmaps/], (*3d Scatter Plots*)[https://plot.ly/python/3d-scatter-plots/] and (*Funnel Charts*)[https://plot.ly/python/funnel-charts/].

However, this didn't stop me from evaluating the data thoroughly with **viz** and some **minor statistical** measures. So have a read if your interested to know what was found!
