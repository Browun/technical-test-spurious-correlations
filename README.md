# Spurious-Correlations

## Intro
This is a **short** *exploratory data analysis (EDA)* and *visualisation* of two random datasets that was required for an interview process; inspired by the work by [Tyler Vigen](tylervigen.com). The data chosen was of Tesla Vehicle Production (units) and US Nonfarm Business Productivity (index) from 2012-Q4 to 2018-Q1. 

It **might** suggest that Tesla cars are improving Nonfarm Productivity in the USA!?!

Kidding aside, it's a exploration of two datasets and highlights the possible directions you could go in with further analysis; whilst still highlighting all the statistical flaws and their remedies a long the way.
Aside from anything else it has **pretty visualization** which can be universally appreciatted. In future I would like to work with broader datasets (>2) to enable the application of the more interesting Plotly/Cufflinks featureas such as [*Heatmaps*](https://plot.ly/python/heatmaps/), [*3d Scatter Plots*](https://plot.ly/python/3d-scatter-plots/) and [*Funnel Charts*](https://plot.ly/python/funnel-charts/).

## Viewing
To see it online I refer you to [Bug Note](##bug-note), alternatively you can clone the repo and use the requirements.txt to setup your own virtual environment and run it!

## Bug Note
The graphs are written in plot.ly and seem to be struggerling to render in gist, please view on [nbviewer](nbviewer.jupyter.org) or another notebook viewer.

For those too lazy to type, the link as of now is [here for nbviewer](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/gist/Brrrowun/bb7e6531b9950d412115a945c3066b24).
